## ABOUT BRIAN

Brian was born and raised in Ohio and is a graduate of Miami University. After a brief stint as a Systems Engineer for General Motors he set off for the University of Arizona to study Creative Writing.

After graduation, he spent two years in Venezuela as a Fulbright Scholar and turned his research into the critically acclaimed book, The Silence and the Scorpion, a “clocked” account of the 2002 uprising against Hugo Chávez. The book was named one of “The Best Books of the Year” by The Economist and was considered by The New York Times as “the most thorough investigation of the April 11th massacre and the subsequent coup.”

His second book, The Last Sword Maker, is an action-packed thriller about a high-tech arms race between the United States and China. It follows a diverse cast of characters as they strive to be the first to make the next generation of weapons using a mixture of artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.

The sequel, Five Tribes, was longlisted by Reading the West for best novel of 2021. The book is a globe-trotting adventure that not only examines the changing face of warfare, but asks what it means to be human in our ever-changing technological world.

The final book in the trilogy, The Great Unmaking, was released in March 2023.

Brian’s other work has appeared in The Virginia Quarterly Review, The Christian Science Monitor and The Southern Humanities Review, among others. He lives in Denver with his wife and two children.

## TUTORING

For the past nine years, I have been teaching to a small number of students. I really enjoy this work and I am delighted that what started out as a small “side gig,” has evolved into dozens of long-term relationships with students and their families.

I teach fiction, nonfiction, essay writing and poetry. My typical student is between 7th and 11th grade. I have sixteen years of experience teaching at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Talented Youth and twelve years of experience teaching at the university level. (Miami University and Stevenson University).

My students have won over 41 regional keys through the Scholastic Writing Awards and over 15 keys at the national level. Some students have participated in the annual National History Day competition and been finalists at both the state and national level. Other students have had their work published in the Best American Teen Writing anthology as well as other teen-oriented magazines. In some cases, their success at writing was a major factor getting into their college of choice.

My program is both fun and challenging and is personalized to fit the student’s needs at their current stage of development. I strive to foster a love of language and get them excited about all the worlds they can create through writing. The strategies I teach will dramatically improve their communication skills and serve them well for the rest of their lives. I feel very strongly that nothing beats one-on-one interaction between a motivated student and a skilled teacher.

Lessons can be done online (e.g., Zoom) and the curriculum can be paced according to the student’s needs.
